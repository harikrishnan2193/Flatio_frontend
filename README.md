#  Flatio

## Description
This project is built using **React.js** working in Vite and **Node.js** for the backend. It follows the **MVC architecture** and uses **MongoDB** as the database. The project includes CRUD operations and that manage data efficiently.

This **Flat Booking System** allows users to manage and book flats within real estate projects. Admins can create CPs (Channel Partners), assign one or more CPs to a project, and add multiple flats to each project. In the Leads section, users can view available flats for a selected project and book them. Once all flats in a project are booked, the project is marked as complete and removed from the booking list.
